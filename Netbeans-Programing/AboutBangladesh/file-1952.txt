1952 : The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general Khawaja Nazimuddin,
staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952. 18] On 31 January, the Shorbodolio
Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at 
the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by Maulana Bhashani.[8][29] The action committee called 
for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies.[18] In an attempt to prevent the demonstration,
the government imposed Section 144 in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.[8]

21 February	Edit

Meeting on the University of Dhaka premises on 21 February 1952.
At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. 
The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past 
eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired tear gas shells towards 
the gate to warn the students.[8] A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards 
the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students 
to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. 
Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the East Bengal Legislative Assembly and blocked the legislators' way, 
asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, 
police opened fire and killed a number of students, including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat and 
Abdul Jabbar.[8][30]
